# pihole_dotconf   
Configuration for PiHole DNS server v.5 and up.   
   
## Usage    
Install PiHole: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#one-step-automated-install
The `pi-hole-v5-teleporter.tar.gz` is the teleporter backup from PiHole, can be used to restore the lists at will from `PiHole wUI > Settings > Teleporter`.   
Included the lists though under their respective directory that can also be used. For adding domains to the whitelist I used this: https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist. A little modification to the script whitelist.sh can pull down the whitelist included in this repo and apply it easily.

## Known issues   
[] Whitelist is far from being complete.
